    I can hear you but I won't
    Some look for trouble while others don't
    There's a thousand reasons<strong> I should <u> Go</u> about my day</strong><!--태그-->
    And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away, oh oh oh</p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;" >
    You're not a voice
    You're just a ringing in my ear
    And if I heard you, which I don't
    I'm spoken for I fear</p>
    Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
    I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls
    I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
    I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
